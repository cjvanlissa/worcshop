<!-- Here, introduce the general principles of open science and the motivation for worcs -->

# Defining Open Science

"Open science is just good science" (Jonathan Tennant, 2018)

* **Conceptually**, transparency / replicability are intrinsic to scientific method

Formal definitions:

* TOP guidelines (Nosek et al., 2015)
* FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016)
---

# Meeting TOP guidelines...

Relevant to openness and reproducibility:

1. **Citation** of literature, data, materials, and methods;
2. **Sharing** data;
3. **Sharing** the code required to reproduce analyses;
4. **Sharing** new research materials;
5. **Sharing** details of the design and analysis;
6. **Pre-registration** of studies before data collection;
7. **Pre-registration** of the analysis plan;

 Relevant to replication:

8. _Replication of published results._

.footnote[[Nosek _et al._, 2015](https://osf.io/9f6gx/#!)]
---

## ...in a FAIR manner

* **F**indable
    + Through standardized repositories or cross-repository search engines
    + With Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
* **A**ccessible online for humans and machines
    + Long-term storage
* **I**nteroperable
    + Open file type
* **R**eusability
    + License data, code, and materials for reuse

# Why open science?

Sterling, 1959:

![](images/sterling_1959.png)
---

# Why open science?

* Scientiﬁc fraud (Levelt, Noort, & Drenth, 2012)
* Questionable research practices (John, Loewenstein, & Prelec, 2012)
* P-hacking / p-ritual (Gigerenzer, 2018)
* Replication crisis (Shrout & Rodgers, 2018)

#### So: Open science as punishment for bad science?

# Open science as a paradigm shift

#### Open Science creates opportunities to make science more
- reliable, 
- cumulative,
- collaborative, 
- inclusive

# Open science as a challenge

#### Where do you start?

#### What tools do you need to learn?

#### What workflow is right for you?

---
# Introducing WORCS

### **W**orkflow for **O**pen **R**eproducible **C**ode in **S**cience
- Standardized workflow
- Low threshold, high ceiling
- Conceptual platform-independent principles: https://psyarxiv.com/k4wde
- "One-click" solution for R-users: https://cran.r-project.org/package=worcs
- Defaults based on best practices (several experts contributed)
- Compatible with journal/university requirements and other workflows
- Pulling down the learning curve!

# The tools

## 1. Dynamic document generation
## 2. Version control
## 3. Dependency management

---

# 1. Dynamic document generation

- Paper consists of **text and code**
- Results, figures, and tables automatically generated
- Formatted as APA paper (including citations!)

### Important because:

- Save time from copy-pasting output and formatting paper
- Eliminate human error in copying results;
- When revising the paper, **all** results are automatically updated;
- Reproducible by default: Just generate the document

# 2. Version control (using Git)

### Why version control?

.pull-left[

- NO MORE manuscript_final_final_SERIOUSLYFINAL.doc

- "Track Changes" on steroids: record entire project history

- If something breaks, you can figure out what happened.

- Facilitates collaboration and experimentation!

]

.pull-right[
![final](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)
]
---

# 2. Version control (using Git)

Tracks changes to (text-based) files line by line:

```{r, out.width="50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/play-changes.svg")
```

* _add_ files to your repository
* _commit_ changes to these files
* _push_ all commits to remote repository (private backup or public online supplement)

```{r, out.width="50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/git-staging-area.svg")
```

One command in `worcs`: `git_update("Describe your changes")`

# Introducing GitHub
.pull-left-larger[
- `worcs` repository is backed up in a remote repository like [GitHub](https://github.com/);

- GitHub is a **"cloud backup"** with **"social networking"** features
    + Clone other people's repository to reproduce or build upon them
    + Open Issues with questions or comments about the work
    + Send suggested changes as a "Pull request"

- GitHub can be used to 'tag' specific states of the repository, e.g. a preregistration.
]

![prereg](images/preregistration.png)

---
# Important because:

- Complete backup of entire project history
    * Go back to previous version if you want
    * Try new things, don't worry about losing work
    * Prove that you preregistered your plans and followed them
- Easy collaboration online (even with strangers)
    * People can copy your project and build on it
- GitHub can be your preregistration, your research archive, supplementary materials, comments section, etc.
- Connects to OSF.io project page
    * Improves **F**indability
    * Get DOI for project and/or specific resources
- Connects to Zenodo
    * Get DOI for project and/or specific resources
    * Store project snapshot

---
# 3. Dependency management

- To make project reproducible, people must have access to your (exact) **software dependencies**
    * For R-users, these are `R-packages`

- Difficult trade-off:

# Dependency management in WORCS

- Maintains text-based list of packages, their version,  
  and origin (e.g., “CRAN”, “Bioconductor”, “GitHub”)
- This list can be version-controlled with Git;
- When a user loads the project,  
    `renv` installs all dependencies from the list
    
### Important because:

- Essential for reproducibility
- Good for collaboration (everybody has same versions)
- Nice to your "future self": Your code will work in the future

<!-- With the background knowledge in mind, let's have another look at the workflow -->
---
# Unique features in `worcs`

* RStudio template
* Easy GitHub integration
    - Add URL during project creation
    - `git_update("Commit message")`
* Manuscript and preregistration templates
    - From `rticles`, `papaja`, and `prereg`
    - Original templates for secondary- and longitudinal data
* Solutions for data sharing
* Cite `@essential` and `@@nonessential`
* WORCS checklist and badge
* Automatic installation check: `check_worcs_installation()`

---

# Sharing data in WORCS

- Reproducibility requires open data
- Some data may be (privacy) sensitive
    * E.g., children's data, veterans' data, patient data

#### Use `open_data()`:

- Original data made public
- Default is a `.csv` (text based, human / machine readable)
- Other save / load functions can be used

#### Use `closed_data()`:

- Original data saved locally;
- Synthetic data created using `synthetic()`
- Synthetic data made public (default: `.csv`)
- Unique ID of original data made public (so people can audit your work)
---


# Sharing data in WORCS

#### Loading data `load_data()`:

- **If** original data are present, load them...
- ...**Else**, load synthetic data
- Scripts can thus ALWAYS be reproduced
- People can create a working script using synthetic data, and send it to you to run on original data
- Load function recorded in `.worcs` file; default `read.csv()`

---

# For non-R-users

* WORCS-paper addresses the **conceptual** workflow
* Covers issues/decisions you have to consider for Open Science, regardless of software
* `worcs` is a good starting point for new R-users
    + Setup Tutorial to help install everything
    + Tricky issues (like project management and using Git) are ~automatic when using the WORCS template
    + Automatic check in case you get stuck: `check_worcs_installation()`
* Learn good habits from the start; don't reinvent the wheel
